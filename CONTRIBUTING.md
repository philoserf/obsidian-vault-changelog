## Development

1. Clone this repository `gh repo clone philoserf/obsidian-vault-changelog`.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Build the project with `npm run build`.

### Using the test-vault

The project includes a test-vault for development:

1. Open the test-vault in Obsidian (`File > Open another vault > Open folder as vault` and select the `test-vault` directory)
2. Build the plugin with hot-reload: `npm run dev`
3. Changes will automatically be applied to the plugin in the test-vault

### Manual installation

Alternatively, you can manually install the plugin in your own vault:

1. Copy `manifest.json` and `main.js` into your **Obsidian plugins folder** (`.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-vault-changelog`).
2. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin.
